# Hospital_ManageMent_System
This is a web based application build using apache-netbeans software.
This is a developed using java swing framework which provide us source and design interface in which we can see how the application will look after development.
Here we can manually add buttons textfields and all are converted into code by itself we only have to write the code for logic and how to connect the pages.
Clone the repo and do changes to improve the application.
Thankyou
